Backend SetupNavigate to the backend directory:cd backend
Install dependencies:npm install
Create an environment file: Create a file named .env in the backend directory and add the following variables.# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mini-crm

# A secret key for signing JWT tokens
JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_and_long_key_that_no_one_can_guess

# The secret key for the initial Admin login
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=124356
Start the backend server:npm run dev
The server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000.2. Frontend SetupNavigate to the frontend directory:cd frontend
Install dependencies:npm install
Configure the API URL: This is a critical step for running on a mobile device.Open the file frontend/context/AuthContext.js.Find the API_URL constant at the top.You must change the IP address from 10.16.33.100 to your computer's local IP address.To find your IP address:On Windows, open Command Prompt and type ipconfig.On macOS or Linux, open Terminal and type ifconfig or ip addr.The line should look something like this: const API_URL = 'http://192.168.1.10:5000/api';Start the frontend server:npx expo start
Run on your device: Scan the QR code generated in the terminal with the Expo Go app on your phone. Your computer and your phone must be on the same Wi-Fi network.Features ImplementedCore Requirements (from PDF)Role-Based Access Control: Separate login and dashboard experiences for Admins and Employees.Secure Authentication: User registration and login system protected by JWT.Customer & Lead Management: Admins can create new customers and new sales leads, assigning them to employees.Employee Workflow: Employees can view a list of only their assigned leads and update the status of each lead (New, Contacted, Qualified, etc.).Bonus Features ImplementedFull CRUD Functionality: Admins have complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for both Customers and Leads.Data Visualization: The Admin Dashboard features a dynamic Pie Chart that provides an immediate visual overview of the distribution of lead statuses.Enhanced Data Integrity: Deleting a customer also automatically deletes all of their associated leads, preventing orphaned data in the database.Improved User Experience:Interactive login and registration forms that show specific, inline error messages (e.g., "Incorrect password," "Invalid email format") instead of generic pop-up alerts.Confirmation dialogs for all delete operations to prevent accidental data loss.UI loading indicators and "pull-to-refresh" functionality on dashboards for a smooth experience.Clean and Secure Backend:Robust error handling and data validation on all backend routes.Role-based protection on all API endpoints, ensuring employees cannot access admin-only data.

Mini CRM ApplicationThis is a full-stack CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application built with a Node.js backend and a React Native (Expo) frontend. The application is designed to manage customers and sales leads, with distinct roles and permissions for Admins and Employees, as outlined in the initial project specification.Tech Stack UsedBackendRuntime: Node.jsFramework: Express.jsDatabase: MongoDB with Mongoose ODMAuthentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)Security: bcryptjs for password hashingEnvironment Variables: dotenvFrontendFramework: React Native with ExpoNavigation: Expo Router (File-based routing)API Communication: AxiosUI Components: @react-native-picker/pickerData Visualization: react-native-chart-kit for chartsSetup InstructionsPrerequisitesNode.js and npm installedMongoDB installed and running locallyExpo Go app on your physical Android or iOS device for testing1. Backend SetupNavigate to the backend directory:cd backend
Install dependencies:npm install
Create an environment file: Create a file named .env in the backend directory and add the following variables.# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mini-crm

# A secret key for signing JWT tokens
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here

# The secret key for the initial Admin login
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=124356
Start the backend server:npm run dev
The server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000.2. Frontend SetupNavigate to the frontend directory:cd frontend
Install dependencies:npm install
Configure the API URL: This is a critical step for running on a mobile device.Open the file frontend/context/AuthContext.js.Find the API_URL constant at the top.You must change the IP address from 10.16.33.100 to your computer's local IP address.To find your IP address:On Windows, open Command Prompt and type ipconfig.On macOS or Linux, open Terminal and type ifconfig or ip addr.The line should look something like this: const API_URL = 'http://192.168.1.10:5000/api';Start the frontend server:npx expo start
Run on your device: Scan the QR code generated in the terminal with the Expo Go app on your phone. Your computer and your phone must be on the same Wi-Fi network.Features ImplementedCore Requirements (from PDF)Role-Based Access Control: Separate login and dashboard experiences for Admins and Employees.Secure Authentication: User registration and login system protected by JWT.Customer & Lead Management: Admins can create new customers and new sales leads, assigning them to employees.Employee Workflow: Employees can view a list of only their assigned leads and update the status of each lead (New, Contacted, Qualified, etc.).Bonus Features ImplementedFull CRUD Functionality: Admins have complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for both Customers and Leads.Data Visualization: The Admin Dashboard features a dynamic Pie Chart that provides an immediate visual overview of the distribution of lead statuses.Enhanced Data Integrity: Deleting a customer also automatically deletes all of their associated leads, preventing orphaned data in the database.Improved User Experience:Interactive login and registration forms that show specific, inline error messages (e.g., "Incorrect password," "Invalid email format") instead of generic pop-up alerts.Confirmation dialogs for all delete operations to prevent accidental data loss.UI loading indicators and "pull-to-refresh" functionality on dashboards for a smooth experience.Clean and Secure Backend:Robust error handling and data validation on all backend routes.Role-based protection on all API endpoints, ensuring employees cannot access admin-only data.
